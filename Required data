Programming questions

Filter the even numbers from arraylist

map the arraylist numbers to number's square 

Print the occurrences of each character of string using java 8 stream

Filter the duplicate numbers form Integer list

I have a Integer list and Group it by  even and odd number

Find the highest number from list and find nth highest number from list

Addition all numbers of list using java 8

Sort the element by ascending and descending order

I have a list of employyes, consider emp class with attributes id, name, sal, age, dept and constructor also to initialize attributes

List <Employee> eList  =  new ArrayList<>();

eList.add( new Employee(id,name,sal,age,dept));

.

. 

We have a employee list above:

Sort the employee list using name

Sort the employee list using name and if name is sam ethen sort by sal

Increase the salary by 10k if emp age >50 and decrease sal by 10k if age<50

Fetch a list Group  it by emp dept

Find the highest sal of employee grouping by it dept - > means higest sal of each department
 
apart from this focus on java 8
